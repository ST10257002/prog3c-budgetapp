🎨 UI/UX & Backend Design Considerations
Great design isn’t just about how things look — it’s about how they work.

UI/UX Design Highlights:
Follows Material Design principles for clean, familiar layouts.

Icons, progress bars, and friendly prompts for intuitive interaction.

Bright color schemes and clear fonts for maximum readability.

Accessibility-first: designed for all users, regardless of ability.

Backend Architecture:
Powered by Firebase Realtime Database — lightweight, cloud-based, and instantly syncs data.

Built with Kotlin using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which separates UI logic, data handling, and business logic.

Designed to be modular, scalable, and testable — perfect for a growing app with evolving features.

In short, the design choices balance user joy with developer sanity.

🔧 GitHub Actions: Purpose and Implementation
Imagine a robot butler that keeps your codebase clean, your builds stable, and your team stress-free. That’s GitHub Actions.

Every time someone pushes code to the repository:

GitHub automatically checks out the latest code.

Sets up the Java Development Kit (JDK) environment.

Runs Gradle to build the project and check for issues.

This CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) process ensures that:

Bugs are caught early.

Builds stay green.

Everyone on the team works in sync.

Bonus: It also saves time, reduces human error, and maintains a professional development pipeline.

✨ Extra Feature 1: Savings Goals Tracker
Ever wanted to save for something big? A PlayStation? A new phone? Maybe just a rainy day fund?

With Savings Goals, you can:

Set a savings target (e.g., R3000).

Track your progress in real-time.

Get alerts if you overspend and threaten your savings path.

You’ll feel like you’re in a game — except the reward is real money, real goals, and real financial growth. 🎯

📊 Extra Feature 2: Category-Based Spending Insights
Where does your money go every month? Do you actually know?

With this feature, BankBoosta helps you:

Categorize your expenses (e.g., food, entertainment, transport).

View beautiful graphs and summaries.

Detect patterns and spending leaks.

You'll spot trends like "I spend too much on takeout" or "Why am I paying for 4 streaming services?" — and take action before your wallet cries.

Knowledge is power — and now, it's colorful and insightful.
