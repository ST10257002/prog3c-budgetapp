🎨 UI/UX & Backend Design Considerations
Great design isn’t just about how things look — it’s about how they work.
UI/UX Design Highlights:
•	Follows Material Design principles for clean, familiar layouts.
•	Icons, progress bars, and friendly prompts for intuitive interaction.
•	Bright color schemes and clear fonts for maximum readability.
•	Accessibility-first: designed for all users, regardless of ability.
Backend Architecture:
•	Powered by Firebase Realtime Database — lightweight, cloud-based, and instantly syncs data.
•	Built with Kotlin using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which separates UI logic, data handling, and business logic.
•	Designed to be modular, scalable, and testable — perfect for a growing app with evolving features.
In short, the design choices balance user joy with developer sanity.

🔧 GitHub Actions: Purpose and Implementation
Imagine a robot butler that keeps your codebase clean, your builds stable, and your team stress-free. That’s GitHub Actions.
Every time someone pushes code to the repository:
1.	GitHub automatically checks out the latest code.
2.	Sets up the Java Development Kit (JDK) environment.
3.	Runs Gradle to build the project and check for issues.
This CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) process ensures that:
•	Bugs are caught early.
•	Builds stay green.
•	Everyone on the team works in sync.
Bonus: It also saves time, reduces human error, and maintains a professional development pipeline.
